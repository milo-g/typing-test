### Usage:

To start the program, run: 
> `ttest`  

Select a mode, `basic` or `advanced`, which are the top 200 and top 1000 words respectively, then a time limit. 

Start the test by pressing any key and type the highlighted words, pressing space to advance. After the test is complete, the program will ask to save the result. While in the test, quit anytime by pressing `esc`.

Use the `analysis` function to get statistics on your aggregate results, and use the `clear data` option to clear all results.
